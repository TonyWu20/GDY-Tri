# GDY Data Visualization

Experimenting visualization of data from GDY-SAC CO2RR-C1 and CO2RR-C2.

# Features

1. `rust` backends of data I/O processing
2. `gnuplot` or `matplotlib` backends for visualizations. (`gnuplot` has better performance)

# Goals

1. Fig.1: polar heatmap of overall reaction pathway energies
2. Fig.2: 3d isometric chart. (For Pathway)
3. Fig.3: (For site)
4. Fig.4: Surface plot (Conclusion, pathway?)
